I shouldn't need to ask for your love.</i> show me that you care the way that I do, <b>i hope im good for you.</b> you know my feelings burning like a match- but i dont think you care so just give me a sign give me a sign, baby.
        <br><br>    
        i wanna be around, but you're making it hard for me to see right through you. i thought i really knew you. <i>we're making no sound, tell me why you're acting like a stranger i thought that we'd be better than this.</i></p>
