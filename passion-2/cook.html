        <h3> go! </h3>

        <ol>
            <li> grab desired amount of rice with a rice cup (I like doing two cups so i can save some for later) and place it in your pot</li>
            <li> you MUST wash your rice at least up to 3 times!! It's to remove excess startch and andy bad stuff on the rice. if you don't... side eye </li>
            <li> after rinsing rice 3 times or until water is less murky, fill the pot up with water again using the rice finger method to measure the amount of water your rice will cook in. (place index finger on top of rice and make sure the water line hits the first line on your finger!)</li>
            <li> after measuring your water, place it in the rice cooker and set it to the right setting for the rice you have cooked. personally i am impatient so i do "quick rice" on mine. </li>
            <li> now you're set! time to play the waiting game. </li>
        </ol>
