        <p> ingredients </p>

        <br>

        <ol>
            <li> grab desired amount of rice with a rice cup (I reccomend two cups for one person) and place it in your pot</li>
            <li> you MUST wash your rice at least up to three times!! if you don't... side eye </li>
            <li> after rinsing rice 3 times or until water is less murky, fill the pot up with water again. but how much water? what a greart question- ill teach you a trick </li>
            <li> when filling up your pot with water make sure the water hits half of the first segment of your index finger when placed on top of the rice. DO NOT stick your entire finger into the pot to where it touches the bottom of the pot. just have your finger tip touch the top of the rice. </li>
            <li> after measuring your water, place it in the rice cooker and set it to the right setting for the rice you have cooked. personally i am impatient so i do "quick rice" on mine. </li>
            <li> now you're set! time to play the waiting game. </li>
        </ol>
